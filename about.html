    <div id="aboutme"><p>My name is Matthew Shizuru and I am a Web Design student at Southwest Career and Technical Academy. I chose to attend Southwest CTA not only because it is an exceptional school, but also to challenge myself and recieve the best education I could. Web Design is something that I found interesting when deciding on my program area but I do not think it is something I see myself doing in the future. However, I will still try and continue to learn about Web Design and see where it takes me. Some careers that I find interest in are sports medicine and the medical field. Things that I enjoy doing are playing sports, spending time with family and friends, and learing about something new. This portfolio is only going to grow as I grow as a person throughout my high school experience, so follow along as I live my life.</p></div>

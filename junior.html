    <h2>Project Explanation</h2>
    <div class="text">
    <p>For this project we entered a contest and had to create an app for a major problem in school today. The first step to completing this project was brainstorming what my group found to be problematic in school. We decided we wanted to take a couple problems that we all struggled with and combine them into an app that can make a students life easier. We had to go through the design and layout of our app and also the content that we wanted in our app.</p>
    <h2>Project Reflection</h2>
    <p>During this project my group faced many problems and had to overcome the problems we encountered. Almost every part of this project was difficult especially when creating the app. My group had a tough time coming up with an app idea because we wanted to make sure we had the best idea. Another problem we ran into was how we would code the app. Several other groups in our class all used a different software to code their app. We were left with the choice of what we wanted to use and eventually decided on just coding the app through HTML. Overall the difficulties faced in this project helped use learn about other softwares used to code apps and problems that students face today.</p>

    <h2>Life on the Mississippi Essay</h2>
    <h3>Winter 2016</h3>
    <iframe src="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LJv-JqsLZLUf8i1L65RKP5pQY4DgoKzo62Ch_dxIgy8/pub?embedded=true"></iframe>
    <h2>Project Explanation</h2>
    <div class="text">
    <p> In my English 11 Honors class we were to read a passage from the book Life on the Mississippi and analyze how language can affect how things are perceived. 
    We then had to write an essay on the language used in the passage and explain why Mark Twain used the language he did. 
    </p>
    <h2>Project Reflection</h2>
    <p> I found this essay to be challenging for many reasons. The main reason was because the passage was a little hard to understand. I wasn’t familiar with some of the words and phrases that Twain used to describe his experience as a student. However, once I was able to decipher the words I hadn’t understood, it was easy to understand why Twain had used the words he did. Each word and phrase has a connotation whether it’s positive, negative, or neutral. By carefully choosing words for their connotative meaning you are able to create a more meaningful writing piece.

    <h2>Project Explanation</h2>
    <div class="text">
    <p>In my graphic design class we were given the task of making a company and establishing our company's purpose. Our teacher put us in groups of 3-4 and we had to collaborate with our company members to create a new company. Our company had to be within the graphic design field, so we came up with the name Aesthete. Aesthete comes from the word aesthetic, and aesthete means an appreciation for art. We felt this fit our company’s purpose and also our image that we wanted to portray. This slide show showcased all of our group members logos for our company and also a brief explanation of what our company was about.</p>
    <h2>Project Reflection</h2>
    <p> I found this project to be a good learning experience. With my program area dealing with Web Design, graphics and art are a big part of web design. Collaborating with my classmates brought to my attention that we all had different ways of designing. Having each other explain why we made each design was interesting to listen to how they designed it. I was able to get a better understanding of how our minds worked differently, but we could also put our ideas together. Overall, I found this project to be very helpful in my understanding of working with others.</p>

    <h2>Project Explanation</h2>
    <div class="text">
    <p>For this project we had to choose a invention that was created during the industrial revolution. We then had to create a presentation to persuade our classmates and teacher to invest in our invention. My group and I chose the cotton gin for our invention and began to research the invention. Once we had our research we had to start to organize our persuasive presentation. Everyones part in the script explains the invention in a positive manner and leads to the persuasion of the audience.</p>
    <h2>Project Reflection</h2>
    <p>This was a tough presentation to prepare for because it was our first presentation in our history class. My teacher said he grades hard on presentations and that made my class nervous. At first my group looked at this in a negative manner, but realized it only made us try harder and make sure our presentation was good. My group made sure to memorize our presentation and create a persuasive presentation to get the audience to invest in our invention.</p>

    <h2>Project Explanation</h2>
    <div class="text">
    <p>In my graphic design class we were given the task of making a company and establishing our company's purpose. Our teacher put us in groups of 3-4 and we had to collaborate with our company members to create a new company. After figuring out our company’s name and purpose we started to draft designs. We helped each other and made sure everyone’s designs followed a similar path. Even though we all created logos that related to the company’s purpose, the designs were all distinct from one another. </p>
    <h2>Project Reflection</h2>
    <p>I felt this project opened up a new creative aspect in my mind. Looking at my group mates designs and also looking at other logos helped me create my own. I realized that I like to design things that will stand out and be noticeable to the consumers eyes. This is a good and bad thing because sometimes it’s hard for me to create simple designs due to my personality and likes. This project helped me grow as a designer and person. </p>

    <h2>Environment Essay</h2>
    <h3>Fall 2016</h3>
    <iframe src="https://docs.google.com/document/d/10cjdhTx3kth3akS4UoC8fJN16pf9bAZMS-JAbPcCOGk/pub?embedded=true"></iframe>
    <h2>Project Explanation</h2>
    <div class="text">
    <p>For this essay I had to choose a topic that would effect my generation in the future. Something that I think will effect my generation in the future is harmful effects to the environment. Global warming is the big factor that causes the negative effects to the environment and also causes the most controversy. I focused my essay on global warming and other harmful things that cause negative effects on the environment. I found this to be a very important topic that my generation needs to be knowledgeable about.</p>
    <h2>Project Reflection</h2>
    <p>This project made me realize how important it is to take care of the environment right now so that the future generations can enjoy the same aspects of nature as us. It is our job to preserve the earth and make sure our future generation of children can experience what we do today. There are other ways that can replace what we currently use to gather energy and other resources. All that is left is to inform people about the environment and how we can save it today.</p>

    <h2>Invention Essay</h2>

    <iframe src="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GomW1uF8QmZf_BCDNDS-OKXyPbIISmPEaVtf9BHl2VQ/pub?embedded=true"></iframe>
    <h2>Project Explanation</h2>
    <div class="text">
    <p>This essay was a continuation of the cotton gin presentation I did. After learning about all the inventions created during the industrial revolution we had to write a persuasive essay on the invention we felt was the most important. After looking back at all the inventions I took into consideration the impact of each one. I felt that the lightbulb had the biggest impact on society today and it has helped us get to where we are today. In the essay I talk about how it has positively affected us and helped us progress to the nation we are today.</p>
    <h2>Project Reflection</h2>
    <p>Overall this essay made me realize how important the industrial revolution was. This time period was essential for our country to develop and grow into what we are today. Every invention had its own impact and some were more important than others. The lightbulb helped us in numerous ways and also led to other inventions during that time period. Without these inventions not only would our society not be where it is today, but the entire world would not be where it is today.</p>

    <h2>EoC Website</h2>
    <h3>Spring 2017</h3>
    <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bvBxJq7SWds" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
    <h2> Project Explanation</h2>
    <div class="text">
    <p>In Web Design we were assigned groups to make a website for students to study for the End of Course exam. We received what content the students needed to study to help us organize the website. Our group went through the usual process of creating and designing a website by starting with the sitemap and wireframe. We used those two things to create our mock ups and other things like our logo. We used WordPress to create this website which made it easier to format things because of the use of templates. Overall,this project was a great learning experience that taught me morea about another language of coding and designing. </p>
    <h2>Project Reflection</h2>
    <p>This project showed me the importance of having a well rounded knowledge of ways to code. Using different languages or softwares depends on the kind of website the client requests. In this case a WordPress website was best fit because the website was to help students study. Using templates and themes help organize information while creating an appealing website. </p>

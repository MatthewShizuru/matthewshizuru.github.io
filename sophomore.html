    <h2>Spring PBL</h2>

    <h2>Project Explanation</h2>
    <div class="text">
    <p>For this last school wide PBL of my Sophomore Year the main focus was environmental issues. We were assigned groups by last name and had to create a game that related to recycling and the environment. The game had to relate to recycling and we had to use our writing skills learned throughout the year to create the rules of the game we made. My groups game was The Ultimate Speedball which was a mixture of sports like basketball, football, and soccer. All of the materials required to play the game were recyclable and easy for anyone to find and use. This presentation explains the game and the other aspects like the field, game rules, and relation to Earth Day.</p>
    <h2>Project Reflection</h2>
    <p>I found this project to be fun and informative. Being so close to the end of the year as we were, we had to use what we learned throughout the school year for this project. I also met some new people and established meaningful relationships with my group mates. Using writing skills in mixture with Earth Day and its history we were able to create a game that everyone could play.</p>

    <h2>Project Explanation</h2>
    <div class="text">
    <p>In my World History Honors class sophomore year, we were assigned an essay on a important event during World War 2. We were paired together with a partner and had to research the topic together. This made it easier to make the essay and also understand the event easily. I always found working together with others makes it easier to create things. Being able to collaborate and put both of my partner and I’s thoughts and ideas together made each other's essays better.</p>
    <h2>Project Reflection</h2>
    <p>When I look back at this assignment I found it to be fun because we were given a partner to work on it with. This was a new concept for me as I’ve never had a teacher give us an essay that we would have a partner. I also enjoyed learning about the war and D-Day. Overall this project was beneficial to me and it improved my collaboration skills.</p>

    <h2>Project Explanation</h2>
    <div class="text">
    <p>This was one of the first websites that I had created. This website was a difficult task and I created it with my guild members in Web Design. For this project we went through the full process of making a website and also including research from a spanish class. My group was assigned a country that we were to focus on and create a tourist site for that specific country. The process started with wireframing and brainstorming what our website would contain and look like. Once we figured out how we wanted the site to look it was just making it from there. Two of our members focused on the content, design, and layout of the site. The other two group members coded the site with what the two designers created.</p>
    <h2>Project Reflection</h2>
    <p>This project was a good learning experience and gave me a general idea of what Web Design is like. Having a group made this project so much easier and it also saved time. Our group worked efficiently by splitting up work and also helping each other at the same time. This project gave me a good feel of my program area and gave me an idea of how I would feel about it.</p>

    <iframe src="https://docs.google.com/document/d/16SpX6X1Euz53-nRbRz-35wAPIktj0toJeSfqQto9fnA/pub?embedded=true"></iframe>
    <h2>Project Explanation</h2>
    <div class="text">
    <p>Even though this was a foods class, my teacher assigned us an essay that was more related to ourseles and our future. We had to answer questions that my teacher had required us to answer in our essay. We had to consider the careers long term and short term aspects. We also had to consider our own happiness and what was more important to us. We had to think about all the different factors of the career and the overall impact it would have on me.</p>
    <h2>Project Reflection</h2>
    <p>This essay really made me think about what I want to do for my career and the rest of my life. It made me realize that I have to make sure I am content with what I choose to do and make sure it is the best choice for me. I had to think about the salary, my family, the environment, and the careers future itself. This essay really made me realize how much thought and consideration it takes when deciding on a career I want to persue.</p>

    <h2>Inspiring Artist Presentation</h2>
    <h3>Spring 2016</h3>

    <h2>Project Explanation</h2>
    <div class="text">
    <p>For this presentation I had to choose an artist from a series of videos that talked about that specific artist and what they do. I had to choose the artist whos career I saw myself doing and related to as well. I chose Nick Onken who is a traveling photographer because I found his job the most interesting. He got to travel the world and take pictures of people and nature. He was able to appreciate people in their natural state and also appreciate the beauty of nature. I found this interesting and something that I might consider as a career.</p>
    <h2>Project Reflection</h2>
    <p>This was another project that made me think about what I want to do for the rest of my life. I had never considered photography until I saw the videos and what Nick Onken really does. It is something that I could see myself getting into and really enjoying. I think any career that involves traveling and seeing the world is something I may consider.</p>

    <h2>Night Essay</h2>
    <h3>Spring 2016</h3>
    <iframe src="https://docs.google.com/document/d/18i5KY8GxkcfdOcldxblA0qeV2HsmSjtFunXPVVWAYss/pub?embedded=true"></iframe>
    <h2>Project Explanation</h2>
    <div class="text">
    <p>For this essay I was to choose a theme that related to the book Night by Elie Wiesel, a song, and myself. First I had to establish my theme and think about something that I had been dealing with lately. I chose faith because of the things going on in my life around then which made me question things and my faith. I also had to find a song that related to the theme faith, and I chose the song Ill Mind of Hopsin 7. I was able to easily compare the theme to all three aspects and explain how it related to the theme as well.</p>
    <h2>Project Reflection</h2>
    <p>Considering the time in my life that I was at this essay was easy and hard to write at the same time. The theme I had chosen was something that I had related to deeply and was also a main theme in the book as well. Because I was able to relate to the theme so much it made writing the essay easy. However, I was hesitant to write about it at first because it was a sensitive topic in my life. I see myself as someone who is shy and does not like to speak about my feelings to others. With losing faith being something I was going through in my life I felt vunerable when writing about it. However, I was able to realize that it made me feel better when I wrote about my feelings and the relation of the theme to myself.</p>

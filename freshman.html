    <h2>Business Software Apps. Company Project</h2>
    <h3>Spring 2015</h3>

    <h2>Project Explanation</h2>
    <div class="text">
    <p>This was the last project I was given in my Business Software Applications class. My teacher put us into groups and we had to start a campaign for an existing brand. My group had decided that we wanted to endorse Club Penguin because we all used to play as kids. We had to create our own company and assets to endorse Club Penguin. We named our company Safeguard Industries because we wanted to endorse more of the saftey aspect of Club Penguin. Using that as our main focus we established our logo, letterhead, and other design assets for our company. We were then to present the company that we chose to endorse to upper classmen. Our job was to persuade the upper classmen to want to use Club Penguin and research it. We used this video to give an overall explanation of what Club Penguin is about.</p>
    <h2>Project Reflection</h2>
    <p>Overall this project had many benefits. My group had two practice presentations in our class to prepare for the final one. I felt my presentation skills improved and it helped me fight my fear of presenting. Also being able to work and collaborate with my group members on what to say and do during the presentation helped a lot. This also helped me as I did another project similar to this in my Junior Year graphic design class. I was able to use the skills I gained from this project in my Junior Year project.</p>

    <h2>Marijuana Debate</h2>
    <h3>Winter 2014</h3>
    <iframe src="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rkKUxQEJjAe0fg3uWH--EvPyaRHnjATlXIFj0GcR6m8/pub?embedded=true"></iframe>
    <h2>Project Explanation</h2>
    <div class="text">
    <p>This was my first debate in high school for my freshman English Honors class. We got into groups of four, and within our groups we split into teams of two. One team was the pro and the other was the con of the topic we would debate. Our teacher gave us some examples of things we could debate, but ultimately let us decide with her approval. My group had decided on the legalization of marijuana for our debate topic. My partner and I were on the pro side and had to debate for the legalization of marijuana. We also learned about the art of debate and tactics to use when debating.</p>
    <h2>Project Reflection</h2>
    <p> I found this project to be fun but also a great learning experience as well. Debating against my classmates was fun and it was nice to have a debate about a topic that we had both researched thoroughly. Learning about the pros of marijuana use changed my perspective on the drug. I had found out about its use with cancer patients and other treatments as well. Having an interesting topic like this made me want to make sure I could defend my side and win the debate. My partner and I found many reasons to why marijuana should be legalized and we ended up winning the debate. </p>

    <h2>Business Software Apps. Contest</h2>
    <h3>Spring 2015</h3>
    <iframe src="https://docs.google.com/document/d/13rGiSVBXTcbSH3xsV47934nXyGJqQiseJOrKA2N56cE/pub?embedded=true"></iframe>
    <h2>Project Explanation</h2>
    <div class="text">
    <p>For this project we entered a contest where we had to make an inspirational video about a concept of our choice and inspire others through the video. I love sports and basketball so I wanted to speak on motivating ones self through working hard and trying to be better everyday. The main theme in my paper and video was that even when times are tough you shouldn't give up and quit. We then had to post the video on youtube and also the website for the contest to enter and hopefully win.</p>
    <h2>Project Reflection</h2>
    <p>This project was something that I found easy to do. I used personal experiences and feelings that I have dealt with before. These feelings and experiences are some that many others have probably felt in their life as well. By using something that connects me to others makes it easier to understand how I feel and the audience feels as well. Overall this project was something I found to be positive and one that I liked and I hope someone took inspiration from it.</p>

    <h2>Graphic Design Photoshop Stamp</h2>
    <h3>Fall 2014</h3>
    <div id="stamp"><img src="img/stamp.PNG"></div>
    <br>
    <h2>Project Explanation</h2>
    <div class="text">
    <p>In the beginning of my freshman year my teacher wasted no time in getting us to designing. This project was done when I was still unfamiliar with photoshop and I was still watching videos from a site called lynda that we used frequently. We had to follow along with the video that showed us how to set up the design of the stamp. Then we had to create our name with a unique placement and combination of shapes.</p>
    <h2>Project Reflection</h2>
    <p>This project has been very helpful to me as I get further and further into highschool. It taught me how to get familiar with photoshop and also how to manipulate different effects and designs. Without these early projects and practicing to get used to photoshop it has helped me progress in my designs. I have used all of the skills I learned in this project in every one of my other graphic design projects.</p>

    <h2>Elevator Speech</h2>
    <h3>Spring 2015</h3>
    <iframe src="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NQL1a2KkDmsm5sy6pQBfRKKXs-ZRjuWP59kYUlsr5sg/pub?embedded=true"></iframe>
    <h2>Project Explanation</h2>
    <div class="text">
    <p>The purpose of this project was to persuade people in a short period of time as if you were talking to them in an elevator. We had to give a pitch about something that we liked, I chose basketball. We had to explain why this thing was so great and why it should interest them. The biggest aspect that was stressed for this speech was time. We had to imagine as if we only had the amount of time it takes for an elevator to take you to your floor. It was important to give the audience the most important information and keep it short and to the point.</p>
    <h2>Project Reflection</h2>
    <p>Overall, this project was very helpful to my presentation skills. We were given examples of good and bad speeches and were abled to learn how to make a good speech.  Learning about good and bad speeches helped me give my presentation in a more informative way. I wanted to make sure I got the point of what basketball is, and also explain the concept as if they had never heard of basketball. I feel like the combination of my speech and presentation skills helped me deliver a great speech.</p>
